# Let's make parental leaves at UBC more equitable.

UBC faculty who become parents by surrogacy or by adoption do not enjoy the same benefits as faculty who are traditional mothers. 

[Nancy Heckman](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/nancy-e-heckman) and [Vincenzo Coia](https://vincenzocoia.com) are spearheading an initiative to make parental leaves at UBC more equitable. Various branches of UBC leadership have been made aware of the issues, and are generally supportive in principle.
